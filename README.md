The **Magazine Creating Project** on **Canva** focused on designing a visually engaging magazine using its extensive library of templates, fonts, and images. We customized a template to fit the theme, adjusting color schemes and adding **high-quality images** to make the content visually appealing. **Text boxes** were used to create articles, headlines, and captions, ensuring readability and flow across the pages.

To maintain consistency, we selected **coherent fonts** and used **graphics** like icons and illustrations to enhance sections. The design process emphasized **balance**, **alignment**, and **hierarchy** to ensure a professional and organized layout. The final product was a polished magazine, ready for digital sharing or printing.
